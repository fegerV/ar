Unify test layout: relocate all tests to test_files/ with clear categorization

## Summary
Implemented unified test structure by relocating all tests from various locations
into test_files/ with clear categorization by type (unit/integration/performance).

## Directory Structure
```
test_files/
├── unit/               # 14 unit tests (from vertex-ar/tests/)
├── integration/        # 44 integration tests (from vertex-ar/, scripts/, test_files/)
├── performance/        # 4 performance tests
├── assets/             # 9 test data files
├── conftest.py         # Shared pytest configuration
└── README.md           # Updated documentation
```

## Changes Made

### Files Relocated
- Moved 14 unit tests: vertex-ar/tests/* → test_files/unit/
- Moved 12 integration tests: vertex-ar/test_*.py → test_files/integration/
- Moved 3 integration tests: scripts/test_*.py → test_files/integration/
- Moved 30+ integration tests: test_files/test_*.py → test_files/integration/
- Moved 4 performance tests: test_files/test_*performance*.py → test_files/performance/
- Moved 9 test assets: test_files/test_*.{jpg,png,mp4,json} → test_files/assets/

### Directories Removed
- Deleted vertex-ar/tests/ (after copying to test_files/unit/)
- Removed all standalone test_*.py from vertex-ar/
- Removed all test_*.py from scripts/

### Configuration Updates
- pytest.ini: testpaths → test_files, coverage → vertex-ar/app
- vertex-ar/pyproject.toml: testpaths → ../test_files, coverage omit → */test_files/*
- .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml: updated all test paths to test_files/{unit,integration,performance}
- scripts/quick_test.sh: updated all test paths and coverage target
- test_files/run_tests.sh: updated TEST_PATHS and added performance option

### New Files
- test_files/conftest.py: shared path setup for all tests
- test_files/__init__.py: package initialization
- test_files/{unit,integration,performance}/__init__.py: category markers
- test_files/README.md: complete rewrite documenting new structure
- TEST_LAYOUT_MIGRATION.md: detailed migration documentation

## Benefits
- Clear organization by test type
- Single location for all tests
- Shared configuration eliminates redundant sys.path setup
- Better test discovery
- Consistent tooling and CI/CD
- Easier to navigate and maintain

## Testing
- ✅ All tests successfully discovered by pytest
- ✅ Unit tests run successfully
- ✅ Integration tests run successfully
- ✅ No tests remain in old locations
- ✅ All tooling updated and tested

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ No Python tests remain under vertex-ar/ or scripts/
✅ All tests in test_files/ with clear substructure
✅ All tooling (pytest configs, scripts, GitHub Actions) updated
✅ Imports succeed via shared conftest.py
✅ Tests execute successfully from repository root
